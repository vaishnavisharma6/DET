\subsection{Introduction}
\textbf{Detection theory}\\
1. Given a set of finite possibilities out of which only one is correct.\\
2. Decide/select one based on a set of random measurements (random/noisy).\\
E.g. Digital Communication, detecting presence/absence of aircraft, Voice/face recognition. \\
Detection: Finite choices, Estimation: Infinite choices.\\
Another example: Transmitter-receiver: bits to symbols, symbols get through noisy channel and then receiver has to find out true bit that was given to transmitter.\\
Bits are equally likely.\\

Cases:\\
1. Channel is perfect, i.e. s = $\hat{s}$. Then just reverse mapping will work.\\
2. Noisy channel: $\hat{s} = s + w$, $w ~ N(0,\sigma^{2})$. So $\hat{s}$ will be $in (-\a, a)$.
